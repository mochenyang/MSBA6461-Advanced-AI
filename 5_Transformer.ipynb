    "The transformer architecture is arguably one of the most important deep learning architectures we have right now. It is the bedrock of virtually all large language models on the market. It has been applied to representation learning tasks for various different types of data, including text, image, video, time series, etc. In addition to its wide applicability, it is also responsible for many state-of-the-art results / performances in AI. The goal of this notebook is to offer an in-depth yet accessible exposition of the transformer architecture (mostly based on [this seminal paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)) with small-scale demonstrations (for actual implementations, please refer to ```pytorch/Transformer.ipynb```)."

    "The transformer architecture we will discuss here largely follows the same encoder-decoder structure, but seeks to completely throw away the RNNs for encoder/decoder, and only uses (a particular kind of) attention mechanism combined with fully-connected feed-forward neural networks (i.e., non-recurrent). \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">But why would you want to throw away the RNNs?</font> One of the key reasons is computational complexity. In a RNN, computations have to be done sequentially (e.g., processing one word after another), which prohibits parallelization. As a result, large-scale tasks with RNNs may become very slow. As you will see, most of the computations in a transformer (especially the self-attention component) can be done in a parallel manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of technical components to a transformer architecture (see figure below), including self-attention, positional encoding, layer normalization, and residual connection. I will explain the intuition behind these components, with an emphasis on the self-attention mechanism. \n",

    "The attention mechanism that we discussed before can be thought of as a \"layer\" that sits between an encoder and a decoder, which allows the decoder RNN to \"pay attention to\" different positions of the encoder hidden states. Because the attention layer is between encoder and decoder, it is often referred to as **cross-attention**. The transformer architecture relies on a twist of this attention mechanism, namely **self-attention**.\n",

    "You can think of self-attention as a mechanism that applies to an input sequence _itself_ (like the visualization above), in order to generate a representation of the sequence that encodes information about how different words in the sequence are related to each other. In a (non-rigorous) sense, it allows the representation of the input sequence to contain information about \"interactions\" among different words in the sequence. Importantly, the entire process of calculating self-attention representation of an input sequence does NOT involve any RNNs or word-by-word recurrence. That's the point of transformer - it is a highly parallel architecture."

    "Now let's get technical about self-attention. Given a sequence of tokens $(e_1, \\ldots, e_T)$ where $e_t$ is the embedding representation (dimension = $D$) of the $t$-th token, the self-attention mechanism seeks to \"associate\" each token with all the other tokens and incorporate those associations into the (attention-enriched) representation of the token.

    "Remember that we throw away the encoder and decoder RNNs, and only rely on self-attention to generate representations of the sequences? Without the sequential RNNs, the model now does not know the sequence of words in the input or output. To counter this loss of information, we try to encode the position of a word in a sequence into the embedding, using **Positional Encoding**. The positional encoding for each word at each position is another vector of the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original paper that proposed transformer, the positional encoding is calculated as follows:\n",
    "$$PE(pos, 2i) = \\sin(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/D}})$$\n",
    "$$PE(pos, 2i+1) = \\cos(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/D}})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you have an input sequence of 5 words, $(e_1,\\ldots, e_5)$, and each $e_t$ is a $4$-dimensional embedding (i.e. $D = 4$). Now you want to also encode the positions of each word. For the sake of demonstration, let's say you want to encode the second position, i.e., $pos=2$. You would use the formula above to compute the following:\n",
    "- Set $i=0$, $PE(2, 0) = \\sin(\\frac{2}{10000^0})=\\sin(2) \\approx 0.91$ and $PE(2, 1) = \\cos(\\frac{2}{10000^0})=\\cos(2) \\approx -0.42$;\n",
    "- Set $i=1$, $PE(2, 2) = \\sin(\\frac{2}{10000^{0.5}}) \\approx 0.02$ and $PE(2, 3) = \\cos(\\frac{2}{10000^{0.5}})=\\cos(2) \\approx 1.00$. Stop here because your embedding only has 4 dimensions.\n",

    "$$e_2 + [0.91, -0.42, 0.02, 1.00]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because, after injecting the positional encoding, _the second word in this sequence will have a different embedding than the same word appearing at a different position in a different sequence_. Essentially, this allows the embedding to contain position-specific information that can help learning. Finally, why using the trigonometry functions? It's mostly for mathematical convenience and it works in practice.\n",

    "Although both encoder and decoder follows roughly the same stacked architecture, they have some important differences that are worth clarifying. For concreteness, let's consider a translation task (like the English-to-Spanish translation task discussed in the \"sequence-to-sequence modeling\" lecture). Suppose the input sequence (in English) is $(e_1, \\ldots, e_T)$ and the output sequence (in Spanish) is $(s_1, \\ldots, s_{T'})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first difference is in the details of self-attention. In the encoder, input sequence go through a **bidirectional** self-attention transformation (as described above), in the sense that every position in the sequence can attend to every other position in the sequence. However, in the decoder, input sequence go through a **masked** self-attention (also called **causal** self-attention), where position $t$ can only attend to positions $i \\leq t$ but not to future positions. This is because, during inference time, we will not know future tokens in the decoding process. The masked self-attention is achieved by replacing the values inside softmax that correspond to illegitimate pairs to $-\\infty$ (which becomes 0 after softmax). Take the 3rd position of the decoder sequence as an example, the \"masked\" softmax values would be $softmax\\left( \\frac{e_3 \\cdot e_1}{\\sqrt{D}}, \\frac{e_3 \\cdot e_2}{\\sqrt{D}}, \\frac{e_3 \\cdot e_3}{\\sqrt{D}}, -\\infty, \\ldots, -\\infty \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is that decoder sequence is allowed to attend to encoder sequence via a standard **cross-attention** mechanism (but not vice versa). Specifically, after all the transformations (across multiple blocks) applied to the input sequence, the encoder will emit a final sequence representation. In each decoder block, the embeddings are allowed to attend to all positions of this encoded squence. This is implemented in the same way as discussed in the \"Attention Mechanism\" lecture.\n",
