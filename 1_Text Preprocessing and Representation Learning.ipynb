This is because we believe that the use of rich and structured languages in communications is a sign of strong intelligence. So, if we can teach machines how to use language to communicate, we have, in a sense, created artificial intelligence.\n",

    "1. **Representation**: How to turn texts into numbers that capture meaningful information of the texts?\n",
    "    - Representation learning is a constant theme in NLP and in machine learning in general. It is about how to best represent your data for the learning task;\n",
    "    - This shouldn't be a completely new concept. You have seen it before outside the context of neural networks (think about SVM);\n",
    "    - We will discuss two representation approaches in NLP: (1) the bag-of-words approach (captures existence/frequency but almost no semantic meaning) and (2) the embedding approach (captures _some_ semantic meaning).\n",
    "2. **Modeling Technique/Architecture**: How to design appropriate modeling techniques that accommodate (and perhaps take advantage of) the unique properties of human language?\n",
    "    - As an example, recurrent neural networks (discussed in a later lecture) are successful for NLP because it is _sequential_, which nicely captures the sequential nature of language;\n",
    "    - The idea of mapping the modeling technique to the unique characteristics of the data goes beyond NLP. For example, think about convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and image recognition."

    "Common text pre-processing steps:\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: break down each document into single word tokens.\n",
    "    - When to use: when the unit of analysis for your task is words.\n",
    "    - When not to use: when the unit of analysis is not words, but perhaps characters or sentences.\n",
    "    - Modern NLP models (such as LLMs) need very complex tokenization modules. See [Andrej Karpathy's Lecture on Tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) as an example.\n",
    "2. **Lower-casing**: transform each word to lower-case.\n",
    "    - When to use: when casing does not provide important information to your task. Lower-casing reduces total number of unique tokens.\n",
    "    - When not to use: when casing carries important information. E.g., capitalization of special abbreviations (think about name entity recognition).\n",
    "3. **Punctuation removal**: remove punctuations.\n",
    "    - When to use: when your task only cares about the actual words.\n",
    "    - When not to use: when punctuation carries important information. E.g., the question mark in a question classification task.\n",
    "3. **Stop-words removal**: remove \"filler\" words, such as \"the\", \"a\" in English.\n",
    "    - When to use: when filler words do not carry actual meanings. Removing them again reduces the total number of unique tokens.\n",
    "    - When not to use: when filler words carry important semantic meanings.\n",
    "4. **Stemming**: reduce words to their semantic \"roots\". E.g., {\"engineer\", \"engineering\", \"engineered\"} $\\Rightarrow$ \"engine\"\n",
    "    - When to use: when your task only cares about word stems.\n",
    "    - When not to use: when different forms of the same stem carry important information (usually the case).\n",
    "    - In practice, we don't do stemming that often because it gets rid of important information.\n",
    "5. **N-Gram generation**: generate phrases that contain N _consecutive_ words. E.g., 2-grams of the \"welcome to my class\" include \"welcome to\", \"to my\", and \"my class\".\n",
    "    - When to use: when word phrases have important information beyond their constituent words. E.g., \"customer service\" together has more information than just \"customer\" + \"service\".\n",
    "    - When not to use: be mindful that there can be a lot of N-grams! If they don't provide much additional value, adding them can drastically increase the number of features and make your algorithms much slower."

As we will show later, such distance turns out to capture the semantic similarity between two words (i.e., how the meanings of two words are similar or dissimilar). This is very useful for NLP tasks. In fact, most NLP deep learning models use word embeddings (rather than TF-IDF values) as input.\n",

    "Finally, it's useful to clarify that the concept of \"embeddings\" is very general and can be applied to other things, like sentence, paragraph, document, and non-language objects such as graph, etc. Here we focus on word embeddings because individual words are usually the \"unit\" of language."
