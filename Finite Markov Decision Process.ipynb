    "A MDP involves an agent (i.e., the decision maker) that interacts with the environment sequentially over time steps $t \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots\\}$ (the total time steps could be finite or infinite, more on this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step $t$, the agent observes state $S_t$ of the environment (i.e., the situation faced by the agent), based on which it takes action $A_t$, which results in a reward $R_{t+1}$ and a new state of the environment $S_{t+1}$. So, a MDP can be thought of as a sequence of state, action, and reward: $S_1, A_1, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3, \\ldots$. <font color=\"blue\">Note that, unlike the bandit model, the states of the environment are crucial for describing a MDP, because the states are affected by, and also affect, the agent's actions. A bandit model can be treated as a MDP with only 1 state that never changes</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lecture (and much of RL), we consider **Finite** MDP, which means that the state, reward, and action all take values from _finite sets_, respectively  $\\mathcal{S}$, $\\mathcal{R}$, and $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the above agent-environment interactions mathematically, we simply write down the probability of observing state $S_{t+1}$ and getting reward $R_{t+1}$ if the agent takes action $A_t$ at state $S_t$:\n",
    "$$p(s', r | s, a) \\doteq \\Pr(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$$\n",
    "where $s,s' \\in \\mathcal{S}$, $r \\in \\mathcal{R}$, and $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$. This is called the **dynamics** of the MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">So, what's \"Markov\"?</font> A MDP is said to have the **Markov property** if the four-element dynamics $p(s', r | s, a)$ _fully_ describes the MDP without having to look further back into the history. That is\n",
    "$$\\Pr(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a) = \\Pr(S_{t+1}, R_{t+1} | S_t, A_t, S_{t-1}, A_{t-1}, \\ldots)$$\n",

    "**So what's our goal in a MDP problem?** We want to choose an action to maximize total reward! Here, we introduce a more general formulation of total reward, called the **discounted total return**:\n",
    "$$G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$\n",
    "where $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is called the **discount rate**. If a MDP has finite number of steps $T$, simply replace $+\\infty$ in the summation with $T$. Intuitively, $G_t$ measures the total future reward starting from time $t$. Our goal is to take action $A_t$ to maximize $G_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">Why do we need discounting?</font>\n",
    "- If the MDP goes for infinite number of steps, having a discount $\\gamma < 1$ makes sure that the return is finite. This is mathematically desirable;\n",
    "- Discount rate intuitively reflects how _myopic vs. forward-looking_ the agent behaves. Smaller $\\gamma$ means that the agent is more myopic - it cares more about short-term return rather than long-term return. **This is important in MDP because you need to consider the long-term consequences of your action**.\n",
    "- If reward is in the form of money, then it intuitively gains value over time. Discounting follows the same concept of compound interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">Question: think about the bandit model from last time. Do you see any disconnect?</font> It seems that when picking $A_t$, we were just trying to maximize the immediate reward. Recall we defined $q(a) = \\mathbb{E}(R_{t+1} | A_t = a)$ and pick $A_t$ to maximize $q(a)$. This is because, in a bandit model, you action at time $t$ does not have any impact on reward beyond $R_{t+1}$. Every time you finish pulling an arm, you get an immediate reward, and then the bandit machine returns to what it was before you pulled it. This again highlights the importance of **states** in dealing with a general MDP problem, where your action can have long-lasting impact, and only maximizing immediate reward can be too myopic."

    "\n",
    "Both policy iteration and value iteration are examples of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. They are useful, but they rely on a critical assumption / prerequisite: that **we have complete information about the environment**, i.e., we know $p(s', r | s, a)$ for all $s,s' \\in \\mathcal{S}$, all $r \\in \\mathcal{R}$, and all $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Every step of the way, we need these four-element probabilities to evaluate and improve policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having complete knowledge of the environment has provided us with many benefits:\n",
    "1. Unlike in the bandit case, where value functions have to be _estimated_, here they can directly be _computed_;\n",
    "2. Remember exploration vs. exploitation? We hardly need to worry about that in policy iteration or value iteration;\n",
    "3. We don't necessarily need to compute $q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ (which is typically needed to get the optimal policy). Instead, we can compute $v_{\\pi}(s)$ (which is computationally cheaper) and rely on $p(s', r | s, a)$ to get the optimal policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption may be realistic for some tasks, e.g., game-play where the rules of the game is known and easy to represent (just like in the grid example). However, as you can imagine, for many other tasks where (1) the rules are unknown or (2) the rules are very hard to represent / codify, we need to other methods. Monte Carlo is one such methods."

    "The basic ideas of Monte Carlo Methods are the same as what we have used to solve the bandit model: **<font color=\"blue\">Learn from actual interactions with the environment.</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of Monte Carlo method is quite similar to that of policy iteration:\n",
    "1. For a given policy $\\pi$, we try to estimate $q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ for all $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and all $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$. This is basically policy evaluation - we want to know how good the policy is;\n",
    "2. Next, we improve the current policy by taking actions according to $\\arg\\max_a q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ for state $s$. This is policy improvement;\n",
    "3. Repeat 1-2 for a sufficiently large number of rounds. <font color=\"red\">Question: why don't we iterate till the policy stops changing?</font> This is not immediately clear - will answer it after implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we estimate $q_{\\pi}(s,a)$? Recall its definition:\n",
    "$$q_{\\pi}(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}(G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a)$$\n",
    "So, here is the outline:\n",
    "1. Generate many sequences of actions and the resulting states and rewards (i.e., interact with the environment many times). Each sequence has a starting state, then follows the given policy until it reaches a terminal state. In our grid example, the process of generating a sequence is like wandering around in the grid until hitting one of the terminal states;\n",
    "2. In a given sequence, average the returns associated with a particular state-action pair (i.e., use sample average to approximate expectation). This is the same as what we did for bandit models."

In general, it can be hard for MCES to discover the exact (stochastic) optimal policy like the other approaches. \n",

The term \"on-policy\" simply refers to the strategy of taking the current policy, follow it to generate sample sequences, evaluate the policy, and then try to improve it over many iterations. In a sense, we are staying _on_ the policy when evaluating it.\n",

The target policy is the one that we evaluate and try to improve upon, whereas the behavior policy is used to generate sample sequences (based on which we do the evaluation of target policy). By designing the behavior policy carefully, one can achieve more sophisticated / advantageous balance between exploration vs. exploitation.\n",

For Finite MDPs, this is called the **policy gradient approach**.\n",
