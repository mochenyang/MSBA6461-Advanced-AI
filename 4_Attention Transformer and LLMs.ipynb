    "The basic encoder-decoder architecture discussed in the last module has achieved significant successes in applications such as machine translation. However, it also has some notable limitations. One important limitation that motivated the attention mechanism is the observation that **different parts of the input sequence are not equally important for predicting the output sequence** (see the simple example below). The basic encoder-decoder architecture cannot capture this aspect, because for each input sequence we only get a _single_ context vector that is used to generate the entire output sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "This also naturally gives rise to the basic idea behind the attention mechanism: Instead of a single context vector, we now compute one context vector specifically for generating one word in the output sequence. That context vector should encode the information from input sequence that is most useful for predicting the target word in output sequence. In other words, we \"align\" the context vector for each target word in the output sequence with words in the input sequence."

    "The transformer architecture represents one of the most recent key breakthroughs in AI research. It has been applied to representation learning tasks for various different types of data, including text, image, video, time series, etc. In addition to its wide applicability, it is also responsible for many state-of-the-art results / performances in AI. Here, we focus on the transformer architecture for language understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture largely follows the same encoder-decoder structure, but seeks to completely throw away the RNNs for encoder/decoder, and only uses (a particular kind of) attention mechanism combined with fully-connected feed-forward neural networks (i.e., non-recurrent). \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">But why would you want to throw away the RNNs?</font> One of the key reasons is computational complexity. In a RNN, computations have to be done sequentially (e.g., processing one word after another), which prohibits parallelization. As a result, large-scale tasks with RNNs may become very slow. As you will see, most of the computations in a transformer (especially the self-attention component) can be done in a one-shot or parallel manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of technical components to a transformer architecture (see figure below), including self-attention, positional encoding, layer normalization + residual connection. I explain the intuition behind these components, with an emphasis on the self-attention mechanism.

    "The attention mechanism that we discussed before can be thought of as a \"layer\" that sits between an encoder and a decoder, which allows the decoder RNN to \"pay attention to\" different positions of the encoder hidden states.

In a (non-rigorous) sense, it allows the representation of the input sequence to contain information about \"interactions\" among different words in the sequence. Importantly, the entire process of calculating self-attention representation of an input sequence does NOT involve any RNNs or word-by-word recurrence. That's the point of transformer - it is a highly parallel architecture.\n",

    "(Optional) More technical details about self-attention and how it is used in the transformer architecture:\n",
    "In a transformer architecture, encoder and decoder each contains several \"blocks\" (note that the original transformer paper calls these \"layers\"). Each block contains a self-attention component and a fully-connected feed-forward neural net. These blocks are stacked; meaning the outputs of a previous block become the inputs of the next block. In other words, from the original input tokens to the final embedding representations, you will go through several times of self-attention and non-linear transformation.\n",

    "where $\\sqrt{D}$ is a scaling parameter based on the embedding dimension to make sure that the embeddings don't \"blow up\" when dimension is high ($e_t^T e_i$ tends to grow as $d$ increases). If you re-write the above in matrix terms, you will see that it's basically the dot-product attention mechanism where key, query, and value are all the same input embeddings. Next, the self-attention transformed embeddings go through a feed-forward neural net layer with a RELU activation followed by a linear projection:\n",
    "$$e_t'' = b_2 + W_2 RELU(b_1 + W_1 e_t')$$\n",
    "The transformed embedding $e_t''$ passes on to the next block (or to the decoder if this is the last encoder block).\n",
    "\n",
    "One more nuance: to enable even more parallelism, people may use something called a **Multi-Head Self-Attention**. The technical details of it are less relevant here, but here's the high-level analogy: you project $Q, K, V$ multiple times with tunable weight matrices, apply the self-attention, then concatenate the results together. See [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) Section 3.2.2 for more information if you are interested."

Without the sequential RNNs, the model now does not know the sequence of words in the input or output. To counter this loss of information, we try to encode the position of a word in a sequence into the embedding, using **Positional Encoding**. The positional encoding for each word at each position is another vector of the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",

    "In the original paper that proposed transformer, the positional encoding is calculated as follows:\n",
    "$$PE(pos, 2i) = \\sin(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/D}})$$\n",

    "Suppose you have an input sequence of 5 words, $(e_1,\\ldots, e_5)$, and each $e_t$ is a $4$-dimensional embedding (i.e. $D = 4$). Now you want to also encode the positions of each word. For the sake of demonstration, let's say you want to encode the second position, i.e., $pos=2$. You would use the formula above to compute the following:\n",

Essentially, this allows the embedding to contain position-specific information that can help learning. Finally, why using the trigonometry functions? It's mostly for mathematical convenience and it works in practice.\n",

However, looking back on what we have learned so far, you really need _fundamentally new ideas_ (e.g., from bag-of-words to embeddings, from simple RNNs to LSTMs, from RNNs + attention to transformers) to achieve significant (non-incremental) improvement. Therefore, although the transformer architecture is the current state-of-the-art, it is fundamentally unclear what else we need for the next breakthrough."
