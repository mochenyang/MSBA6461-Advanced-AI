    "    - Most of the topics covered in this course have been hailed as \"AI\". But the what it means for a technology to be \"AI\" keeps changing;\n",

    "    - NLP: embedding, recurrent neural network, LSTM, GRU, encoder-decoder architecture, attention, transformer, etc.\n",
    "    - Reinforcement Learning: agent, policy, states, value iteration, policy iteration, Monte Carlo, etc.\n",
    "3. Train technical skills to use the techniques discussed in this course:\n",
    "    - NLP: {`sklearn`, `nltk`, `keras`, `numpy`}.\n",

    "## (My Suggestions for) How to Learn in This Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Please consider the following suggestions when developing your own study plan:\n",
    "1. Ask questions, then ask more questions:\n",
    "    - These are complex / advance / challenging topics that are not easy to understand, and we go reasonably deep in this course;\n",
    "    - At some point, you will get confused. That's when you need to speak up (during class, schedule appointments with me, etc.) to get further clarifications;\n",
    "    - I reserve the right to say \"I don't know\".\n",
    "2. Be a critical learner. Always bear in mind that the topics we cover are \"cutting edge\":\n",
    "    - With the exception of the reinforcement learning module (which is relatively well established), almost all of the NLP topics we cover are developed in the past decade (many developed in the past 3-5 years);\n",
    "    - It means that you should not treat them as \"absolute truth\", but rather \"our current state-of-the-art\";\n",
    "    - Hopefully this prevents you from thinking \"deep learning solves all my problems\";\n",
    "3. Get your hands dirty:\n",
    "    - For me, the best way to learn complex algorithm / technical concept is to implement it myself;\n",
    "    - Coding in this course is often more than calling some well-written functions in some packages. Some advanced NLP models are too new and most reinforcement learning models are too idiosyncratic to be implemented in standard packages;\n",
    "    - Spend time examining the code (and practice yourself) not only helps you with technical skills, but also facilitates the understanding of the underlying concepts and algorithms."

    "    - For both assignments, your score depends objectively on (1) model performance and (2) exploration effort.\n",
    "- There will be one larger-scale individual project that runs through the entire course ($50\\%$)\n",
    "    - Pick a real-world topic that interests you and are relevant to your career (e.g., a business problem, an industry, or even a specific application), where _either_ advanced NLP or reinforcement learning can be applied to create value;\n",
    "    - Conduct in-depth research on the topic, with a few milestones to meet along the way:\n",
    "        1. A 1-page proposal to outline the topic of your choice ($5\\%$).\n",
    "        2. A mid-point one-page memo to update me on your progress ($5\\%$).\n",
    "        3. A final report to summarize everything you have learned on the topic ($40\\%$).\n",

For instance, if you have 100 training data points and adopt a batch size of 20, then you can perform 5 gradient descent iterations (i.e., parameter updates) during one scan pass of the training dataset.
